# Project Name
Weekend Monthly Salary Calculator

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

**This calculator allows the user to calculate the monthly costs of a business's salaries, using the First Name, Last Name, ID, Title, and Salary fields to add employees to a table that tabulates and calculates the salaries. One issue I had with this project was manipulating the submitted salaries into something I could actually use in the program's calculations. Removing commas and dollar signs in particular was quite difficult to figure out. But, I was able to use a method along with regex to parse the salary strings for those characters and remove them. Then, the other side of that problem was re-formatting the salary number BACK to a string, along with dollar signs, commas, and decimal points. Thankfully toLocaleString() exists ðŸ˜Š (though I've since learned there are better ways)**
